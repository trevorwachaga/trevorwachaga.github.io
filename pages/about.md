    <h2>Hello! My Name is Trevor Wachaga</h2>

    <p>
    I am a First-Class Ethical Hacking & Cyber Security graduate, currently pursuing a career in IT Support, with the long-term goal of progressing into Cyber Security.
    </p>

    <p>
    I have hands-on experience working with Window and Linux systems, building virtual machines and configuring technical environments. Through my academic and personal projects, I have developed practical skills in networking, security principles, system monitoring and troubleshooting. This includes developing a phishing detection tool using Python and deploying an ELK Stack to monitor network activity.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am passionate about technology and enjoy understanding how systems work, identifying issues and finding solutions, leveraging my problem solving and analytical skills. My customer-facing roles have strengthened my communication skills, ability to work under pressure and a professional approach to supporting others. 
    </p>

    <p>
    I am currently expanding my portfolio, building home lab environments, and continuously developing my technical skills using platforms like Microsoft Learn, Hack The Box and personal lab projects. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Outside of technology, I enjoy going to the gym, playing football, running, hiking and watching films.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am actively seeking an entry-level IT Support role where I can contribute, learn and continue developing my skills.
